# RP2040 Flight Computer Software in C++ (work in progress)
Beginning code for a rocket flight computer. Programming is done in C++ for the RP2040 microcomtroller. This chip will interact with other chips to build out the entire flight computer. The primary purpose for this chip is data collection from the sensors.

## Custom Libraries to Make
- ICM 20948 IMU library
- DPS310 Barometric pressure sensor
- GPS (TBD)
